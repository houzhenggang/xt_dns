Netfilter extension to match various DNS atributes
==================================================

by Ondřej Caletka, 2013

This work is based on the original xt_dns netfilter
extension, written by Bartłomiej Korupczyński
http://software.klolik.org/xt_dns/


This fork addes availability to match queries, or
responses, to match query type (eg. ANY) in queries
or even in responses and also to match packet with
EDNS0 pseudo-RR and with specific bufsize range.
The matching algorithm is fully RFC 1035 compliant.

Only non-fragmented UDP packets are supported, both
IPv4 and IPv6.
